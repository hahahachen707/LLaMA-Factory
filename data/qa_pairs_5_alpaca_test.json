The robotic arm is visible from multiple angles, showing a well-defined end-effector with a gripper apparatus. The object identified as 'the money' is situated beneath the end-effector, based on positional cues such as the object being located to the right and in front of the base of the robotic arm in the images.\", \"object_state\": \"The money is currently grasped by the robot's end-effector. The gripper appears to be in a closed state, securing hold of the object above the surface.\", \"reasoning\": \"The instruction was to 'grasp onto the money,' which entails the robotic arm successfully using its gripper to pick up and secure the money. The visual evidence from the images shows the end-effector's gripper closed around the money, indicating that the robot holds the object securely. These observations align with the task requirement since the grasp has been achieved as instructed.\", \"task_completion\": \"yes\"}",
